# Kickstarter: A Platform for Visionaries

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Kickstarter
* Founded in April 28, 2009
* Founders: Perry Chen, Yancey Strickler, Charles Adler
* ⦁	The idea for the company started in 2001 when founder Perry Chen wanted to bring a pair of DJ's to the 2002 Jazz Fest. The show ended up not happening because the cost was too much. That's when it occured to him, “What if people could go to a site and pledge to buy tickets for a show? And if enough money was pledged they would be charged and the show would happen. If not, it wouldn't.” 
* ⦁	Everything is funded by the public and money goes directly to the creators of the projects. The company earns its revenue by charging a 5% commission fee on the total funds raised. To this date, the site has seen over 7.2 Billion dollars pledged with 6.57 Billion of those being 'successful' dollars.

## Business Activities

* ⦁	Their mission is to help bring creative projects to life. The goal is to provide a platform for creators to connect directly with their communities to generate a project that will have an impact in our culture. They don't want our culture to be defined by art elites and business giants.
* ⦁	The inteded customer is anyone with an idea or creative project in mind. The advantage of Kickstarter is that it is very popular, making it more likely for projects to be funded.
* ⦁	They use a lot of open-source software. A list of this software would include:
Babel, Webpack, Advent of Code, Rails Girls Summer of Code, Code Nation and Code Cooperative.

## Landscape

* ⦁	Kickstarter is part of the crowdfunding domain of FinTech. Crowdfunding refers to the practice of funding a project or venture by raising many small amounts of money from a large number of people. 
* ⦁	One of the biggest trends in the market was reward-based crowdfunding which saw a big increase during the 2020 pandemic. This increase was seen throughout the European market and is expected to gain popularity in Japan as well. With reward-based crowdfunding, you can avoid debt financing and the associated interest payments. This is because you only need to raise the funds you need to finance your business or project and do not need to take out loans with interest payments that must be repaid regardless of whether your venture is successful.
* ⦁	Other competitors in the crowdfunding market include Indiegogo Inc, gofundme inc, Fundable LLC and Crowdcube Limited. These along with Kickstarter are considered the 5 major players and current market leaders.

## Results

* ⦁	The overall impact of the company is shown in the 7.2 Billion dollars that have been pledged so far since its beginning. On a smaller scale, there are several individual cases of communities that have been affected in a positive way by Kickstarter. One example is the story of illustrator Jed Henry who launched his own project after being inspired by his friend Jake Parker's successful campaign. Jed was able to raise $313,341 from 2,422 backers for his project Ukiyo-e Heroes which takes traditional Japanese art and gives it a modern pop flair.
* ⦁	One of the key metrics in crowdfunding is the number of investors or in this case backers. 
* ⦁	With its 2,422 backers, it's no question why Kickstarter is the leading platform when it comes to crowdfunding.

## Recommendations

* ⦁	Some people have resorted to promote their campaign after it ends in Kickstarter to keep the funding going. They start on Kickstarter and then go to Indiegogo because they offer a program called InDemand.
* ⦁	InDemand allows you to continue funding your campaign from any platform.
* ⦁	I think because of the popularity of Kickstarter, if they offered something like InDemand on their platform it would help keep the customers loyal and exclusive to just Kickstarter.
